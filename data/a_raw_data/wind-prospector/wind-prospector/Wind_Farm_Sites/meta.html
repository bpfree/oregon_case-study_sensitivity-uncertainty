<p><strong>Wind Farm Sites</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>This layer was developed by <a href="http://en.openei.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenEI</a> to display installed, under construction and proposed wind project sites. Data was compiled using a variety of shared and publicly available information. Point locations represent the best available information for the project site or a randomly chosen location within larger projects, usually based on visibility of installed turbines using tools such as <a href="https://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> or <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/">Bing Maps</a>. The most recent version of data and references are available for download at <a href="http://en.openei.org/wiki/Map_of_Wind_Farms" target="_blank">OpenEI Map of Wind Farms</a></p>
