<p><strong>Electric Retail Service Territories</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>The Electric Retail Service Territories layer represents the service areas of companies who report retail and/or commercial electricity sales to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) via their form 861. These companies may be investor-owned utilities, electric cooperatives, municipalities, power marketers, etc. Often features in this layer can serve as proxy for areas of electric distribution line ownership.</p>

<p>This layer contains some overlapping features where more than one company reports service to a specific community (occurs more frequently within deregulated states). Also note that some investor-owned utilities may no longer be represented in this layer because they no longer report sales within EIA 861 data (i.e. AEP in Texas). Features in this layer are created utilizing the best available sources with Global Energyâ€™s industry datasets and knowledge. Despite best efforts this dataset is meant only to be a representation or reference for Electric Retail Service Territories and does not reflect any real or ground condition.</p>

<p>Energy infrastructure for electric retail service territories is taken from the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) Gold (Unclassified) 2012 release. This dataset was produced and licensed by Ventyx to be compiled in the HSIP release and represents major structures (power plants &gt; 50 MW/transmission lines &gt;100 kV) in the United States. Smaller facilities may be included where information was available but data is not expected to be complete below those thresholds. Any screen capture or graphic print including this data should include a citation for HSIP Gold 2012.</p>
