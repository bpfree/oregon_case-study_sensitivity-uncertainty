<p><strong>Airports</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>The Airports layer is a geographic point dataset of aircraft landing facilities in the United States, including major locations within a 100 mile distance of United States borders. Attribute data is provided on the physical and operational characteristics of the landing facility, current usage including enplanements and aircraft operations, congestion levels and usage categories.</p>

<p>Airport attributes were obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) National Airspace System Resource Aeronautical Data and the Office of Airline Information (OAI) Enplanement Data. The FAA Data was published by the Aeronautical Information Services with an Effective Date of February 9, 2012. All records were assigned the accurate state name, state abbreviation and FIPS code.</p>

<p>All point records in this dataset are represented by a single coordinate pair and two unique feature identifiers – the landing facility location identifier (LOCID) and the site number (SITE_NO) assigned by the FAA. BTS quality checks were to cross reference the place dataset with the state dataset, to determine that the spatial data and attribute data were accurate.</p>
