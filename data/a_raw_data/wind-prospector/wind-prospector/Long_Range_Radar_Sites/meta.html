<p><strong>Long Range Radar</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Long Range Radar locations were published by the Federal Aviation Administration at the city level in 2006. This radar type looks at airspace up to 200 km or more from the radar site to identify objects, and may impact the siting of wind farms within their vicinity. Individual wind projects need to be evaluated for their radar impact. Layers evaluating radar line of sight analyses impacts are included separately in this tool.</p>
