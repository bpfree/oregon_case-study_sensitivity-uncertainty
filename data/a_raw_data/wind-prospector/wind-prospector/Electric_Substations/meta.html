<p><strong>Electric Substations</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>The Electric Substations layer depicts significant substations and taps that exist in United States’ power transmission grids. Substations (facilities that switch, change, and/or regulate electric voltage) are snapped into segments of the Transmissions Lines layer and are found at every feature in the Electric Power Generation Plants layer. Some features are programmatically created directly on top of features from the Electric Power Generation Plants layer in order to accurately depict the power grid in cases when the power plant’s step-up substation has not been identified. Taps are snapped into segments of the Transmission Lines layer to designate junctions and connections as well as changes in ownership. This layer contains existing and proposed features.</p>

<p>Energy infrastructure for electric substations is taken from the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) Gold (Unclassified) 2012 release. This dataset was produced and licensed by Ventyx to be compiled in the HSIP release and represents major structures (power plants &gt; 50 MW/transmission lines &gt;100 kV) in the United States. Smaller facilities may be included where information was available but data is not expected to be complete below those thresholds. Any screen capture or graphic print including this data should include a citation for HSIP Gold 2012.</p>
