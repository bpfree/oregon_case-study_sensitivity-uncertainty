<p><strong>Eastern Wind Dataset</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>The Eastern Wind Dataset contains modeled wind farm data points for the eastern United States for 2004, 2005, and 2006. It is intended for use by energy professionals such as transmission planners, utility planners, project developers, and university researchers who perform wind integration studies and estimate power production from hypothetical wind plants.</p>

<p>The Eastern Wind Dataset consists of three years (2004â€“2006) of 10-minute wind speed and plant output values for 1,326 simulated wind plants as well as next-day, six-hour, and four-hour forecasts for each plant. AWS Truepower created the dataset with oversight and assistance from NREL. AWS Truepower's <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/electricity/transmission/pdfs/aws_truewind_final_report.pdf" target="_blank">final report</a> describes the overall project and provides more information about the modeling and inputs.</p>
