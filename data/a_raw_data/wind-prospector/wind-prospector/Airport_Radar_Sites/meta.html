<p><strong>Airport Surveillance Radar</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Airport surveillance radar sites in the United States. Point locations and attribute information were extracted from the <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/">National Resource Defense Councilâ€™s</a> (NRDC) Renewable Energy and Defense Geospatial Database (READ-Database). The NRDC developed the data using information obtained from the <a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/AERO/uddf" target="_blank">National Geodetic Survey</a>.</p>

<p>The defense-related information used by NRDC to develop this data layer was compiled from open sources and from unclassified geospatial data provided by the Department of Defense. This information may not be current and does not necessarily reflect the official policy of the Department of Defense or the U.S. Government, and should be used for preliminary planning purposes only. If use of this tool indicates an intersection of your planned project and a DoD equity, you should contact the DoD Siting Clearinghouse at <a href="DoDSitingClearinghouse@osd.mil" target="_blank">DoDSitingClearinghouse@osd.mil</a>. Indeed, DoD encourages all renewable energy developers to contact the Siting Clearinghouse as early as possible in the siting process.</p>
