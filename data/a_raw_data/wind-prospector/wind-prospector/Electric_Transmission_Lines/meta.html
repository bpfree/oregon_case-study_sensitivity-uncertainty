<p><strong>Electric Transmission Lines (&gt;100kV)</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>The Transmission Lines layer depicts market significant electric power transmission lines in the U.S. with a capacity of greater than 100 kilovolts. Features in this layer often represent multiple circuits. Some features have been created in order to link major features from the Electric Power Generation Plants layer to the electrical grid through the associated feature from the Substations layer.</p>

<p>Energy infrastructure for transmission lines is taken from the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) Gold (Unclassified) 2012 release. This dataset was produced and licensed by Ventyx to be compiled in the HSIP release, and represents major structures (power plants &gt; 50 MW/transmission lines &gt;100 kV) in the United States. Smaller facilities may be included where information was available, but data is not expected to be complete below those thresholds. Any screen capture or graphic print including this data should include a citation for HSIP Gold 2012.</p>
