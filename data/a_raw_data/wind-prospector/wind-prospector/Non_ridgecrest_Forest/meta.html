<p><strong>Non-ridge Forest</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>The U.S. Geological Survey national 1 km spatial resolution National Elevation Dataset was processed using a topographic position algorithm to identify ridge, valley, toe slope, and flat features. Depending on the scale of the local geographic feature, the national level analysis may not identify a local small or narrow ridge feature. This information was combined with the U.S. Geological Survey 1 km spatial resolution 2001 national land cover dataset to identify those features that are forested, and not on a ridge. These areas represent locations that may be more difficult to develop or entail additional site development costs.</p>
