<p>These estimates show, for each of the 48 states and the contiguous U.S., the land area with a gross capacity factor (GCF) of 35% and greater. The calculated area illustrates wind energy potential that could be possible from development of the “available” land area after exclusions.  The “Potential Installed Capacity” shows the potential megawatts (MW) of rated capacity that could be installed on the available land area, and the “Annual Generation” shows annual wind energy generation in gigawatt-hours (GWh) that could be produced from the installed capacity.   AWS Truewind, LLC developed the wind resource data for <a href="http://navigator.awstruewind.com">windNavigator®</a> with a spatial resolution of 200 m.  NREL produced the estimates of land area and energy potential, including filtering the estimates to exclude areas unlikely to be developed such as wilderness areas, parks, urban areas, and water features.
