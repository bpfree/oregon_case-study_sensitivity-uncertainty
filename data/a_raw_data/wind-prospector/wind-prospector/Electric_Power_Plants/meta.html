<p><strong>Electric Power Generation Plants</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>The Electric Power Generation Plants layer depicts significant power plants within the United States power grid. Although power plants often comprise a relatively large geographic region, features in this layer are symbolized using a single point; the point is placed at the location of the highest density of generation capability within the plant complex.</p>

<p>Energy infrastructure for electric power generation plants is taken from the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) Gold (Unclassified) 2012 release. This dataset was produced and licensed by Ventyx to be compiled in the HSIP release, and represents major structures (power plants &gt; 50 MW/transmission lines &gt;100 kV) in the United States. Smaller facilities may be included where information was available, but data is not expected to be complete below those thresholds. Any screen capture or graphic print including this data should include a citation for HSIP Gold 2012.</p>
