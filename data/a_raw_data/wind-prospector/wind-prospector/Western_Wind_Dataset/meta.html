<p><strong>Western Wind Dataset</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>3TIER created the Western Dataset with oversight and assistance from NREL. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models were used to essentially recreate the historical weather for the western U.S. for 2004, 2005, and 2006. The modeled data was temporally sampled every 10 minutes and spatially sampled every arc-minute (~2 kilometers). The wind data is presented in Greenwich Mean Time.</p>

<p>In conjunction with NREL, these 1.2 million grid points were screened to eliminate recreational and other non-developable areas. Further sites were chosen from the remaining sites using an iterative selection algorithm. First, promising sites were selected based on proximity to planned transmission projects and energy zones and based on wind energy density. The next selection phase chose a number of sites in each state (determined by the relative importance of the state in the study) based on the correlation of the wind's diurnal cycle matched with the load profile in the study (with a mean wind energy density of at least 300 W/sqm).</p>
