<p><strong>Radar Proximity - High Barrier Scenario</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>This layer was developed by the Wind Barriers analysis project, evaluating potential radar issues on wind development. The analysis developed two scenarios for each barrier, a moderate and high barrier case. The moderate barrier scenario completely restricts a small area close to the radar site where siting a wind farm would have significant impact to radar operations. The high barrier scenario combines the moderate barrier with identification of areas within line-of-sight of a radar site over a larger distance.</p>

<p>The distances vary by type of radar:<br />
**</p>

<ul>
  <li>weather radar: 3 km moderate/36 km high</li>
  <li>airport radar: 3 km moderate/50 km high</li>
  <li>long range radar: 5.5 km moderate/100 km high</li>
</ul>
