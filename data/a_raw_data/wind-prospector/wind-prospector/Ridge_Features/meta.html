<p><strong>Ridge Feature</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>The U.S. Geological Survey national 1 km spatial resolution National Elevation Dataset was processed through a topographic position algorithm to identify ridge, valley, toe slope, and flat features. Depending on the scale of the local geographic feature, the national level analysis may not identify a local small or narrow ridge feature.</p>
