The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Wind and Solar Programs funded the Wind Integration National Dataset (WIND) Toolkit data creation. The WIND Toolkit consists of a wind resource and a forecast data set. Wind resource data was generated on a 2 km by 2 km grid with 20-m resolution from the ground to 160 m above ground, and includes meteorological and power data every 5 minutes. The forecast data set was created on a 6-km grid at 1-hour, 4-hour, 6-hour, and day-ahead forecast horizons using industry best practice. Focus was on mimicking state-of-the-art forecast accuracy. The power data were created using data from actual and hypothetical wind farms for 126,000 land-based and offshore wind power production sites. The WIND toolkit provides barometric pressure, wind speed and direction (at AGL), relative humidity, temperature, and air density via an online data interface.</p>
