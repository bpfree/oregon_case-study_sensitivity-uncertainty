<hr />
<p>These are 2016 rates calculated for residential, commercial and industrial sectors from <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser">data reported by EIA through the electricty data browser</a>.
Rates were matched from EIA data to ABB Ventyx service territory shapes. Where a match could not be made or no territory was available, a state average of the EIA data was used as backfill.
Data were then averaged by county using a population weighted average with LANDSCAN population esitimates. Data are reported by sector in $/MWh.</p>
