<p><strong>ReEDS Regions</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>The Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model is an NREL computer model that optimizes the regional expansion of electric generation and transmission capacity in the continental United States over the next 50 years. The regional structure of ReEDS was created utilizing 2002 county boundaries, aggregated to form 356 regions in the contiguous 48 states. Decisions on how to aggregate the counties into regions were based on the following criteria: separate areas of significant renewable resource potential; separate large load centers; conform to power control areas; conform to NERC regional boundaries; and conform to state boundaries.</p>
