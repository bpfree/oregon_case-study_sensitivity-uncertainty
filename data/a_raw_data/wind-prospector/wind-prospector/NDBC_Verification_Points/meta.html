<p><strong>National Data Buoy Center Verification Points</strong></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Description:</strong>
NREL has completed wind data verification by selecting a geographically diverse collection of points at which to compare the data product created for this project to other available datasets. Seven points have been selected for verification, including 1 point off the coast of Washington, 1 point off the coast of Oregon, 2 points off the coast of California and 3 points off the coast of Hawaii. The points were selected to provide geographic diversity, to coincide with available buoy measurement data where available, and to coincide with available reanalysis data. For these points, NREL has performed verification by comparing the scaled MERRA results to NDBC buoy data and ERA-Interim reanalysis data. The modeled area is outside the geographic area modeled by the NNRP re-analysis dataset. MERRA and ERA-Interim integrate similar but not exactly the same selection of data inputs to generate model outputs. One input of both reanalysis datasets is the NDBC buoy data. Therefore, if the models are performing as expected they should reflect similar distributions of wind speed and direction to one another and to the buoy data. Comparison of these datasets allows NREL to either verify this expectation or to identify necessary corrections.</p>
