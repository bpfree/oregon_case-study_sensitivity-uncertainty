<p><strong>Offshore Wind Speed - 90m</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>This layer represents the predicted mean annual wind speeds at 90-m height presented at a spatial resolution of 200 m. Areas with annual average wind speeds of 7 meters per second (m/s) and greater at 90-m height are generally considered to have a wind resource suitable for offshore development. More information on the characteristics and validation methods can be found in the report <a href="http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov/pdfs/offshore/offshore_wind_resource_assessment.pdf" target="_blank">Assessment of Offshore Wind Energy Resources for the United States</a></p>
