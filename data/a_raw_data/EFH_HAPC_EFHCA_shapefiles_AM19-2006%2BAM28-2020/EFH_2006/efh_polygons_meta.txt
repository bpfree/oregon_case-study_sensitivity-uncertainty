      Title: Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) off Washington, Oregon, and California for NMFS' Final Rule Implementing Amendment 19 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan
      Geospatial_Data_Presentation_Form: vector digital data
  Description:
    Abstract: These data depict Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) boundaries off Washington, Oregon, and California.  The coordinate locations are from NMFS' Final Rule to implement Amendment 19 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (71 FR 27408; May 11, 2006).  In order to minimize to the extent practicable adverse effects from fishing, the final rule prohibits fishing with various gear types within these areas.  Consult the text of the final rule for specific details about each area and the management measures. The prohibitions are listed in Section 660.306 and the official coordinates are listed in Section 660.395 of the final rule.  
    Purpose: These data were developed to support implementation of NMFS' Final Rule implementing amendment 19 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP).
    Supplemental_Information:  These boundaries were created by an automated process to extract the coordinates from the text of the Final Rule.  Any discrepancies between these coordinates and the Federal Register will be resolved in favor of the Federal Register.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Attributes were generated via an automated process from the text of the Federal Register document.  Attributes were visually assessed for accuracy.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: The areas were derived from the Federal Register document, and the caveats associated with the source data would apply to this line.
  Completeness_Report: The areas are complete within the west coast Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Horizontal accuracy is assumed to be absolute because coordinate locations were extracted in an automated process from the text of the Federal Register.
