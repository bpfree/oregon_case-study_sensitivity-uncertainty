Thank you Amber! 

I'll add the Data Documentation pdf file into the package and I will request accession for the data package well. After that, I will make the date corrections on my end. 

Thank you and please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Mia,

For the mismatched dates issue, the P.I. corrected the start and end dates in the DataDocumentation PDF. That updated PDF is attached to this email. Please use it to replace the DataDocumentation PDF that was originally sent in with the S2N submission. 

Due to the DataDocumentation being updated, the start/end dates in the S2N submission need updating as well. If this is something that's easily done without rejecting the submission and starting from scratch, I would prefer to do it that way. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks again Mia!

Good morning! 

I looked at your data files with other DCMs and your data is fine. Everything was able to open and view in both ArcMap and ArcPro, no files have any issues. Thank you for your patience on that as I reviewed it. 

On the data dates, I know on Monday you said you tried to access S2N to make the corrections. The steps we can take is where I can reject the package and you can submit the S2N again with the corrected dates. If the submission takes a while to upload the data and copy the info, I could make note of the correction on my end. I would put our emails discussing the dates in the about folder of the package, make the correction in AMS and mention it to the Data Officer. 

Please let me know how you would like to proceed. 

Thank you, 

Mia Infante
