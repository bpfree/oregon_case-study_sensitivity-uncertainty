# Case Study: Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analyses for Oregon wind siting
Creating a case study on sensitivity and uncertainty analyses for Oregon wind siting.

#### **Repository Structure**
* **data**
  - **raw_data:** the raw data integrated in the analysis (**Note:** original data name and structure were kept except when either name was not descriptive or similar data were put in same directory to simplify input directories)
  - **intermediate_data:** disaggregated processed data
  - **submodel_data:**
  - **suitability_data:**
  - **rank_data:** 
  - **sensitivity_data:**
  - **uncertainty_data:**
* **code:** scripts for cleaning, processing, and analyzing data
* **figures:** figures generated to visualize analysis
* **methodology:** detailed [methods](/methodology.pdf) for the data and analysis

**_Note for PC users:_** The code was written on a Mac so to run the scripts replace "/" in the pathnames for directories with two "\\".

_Known issues_
The hexagonal grid in R is slightly different than a tessellation grid that ArcGIS Pro generates in its [data management toolbox](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/data-management/generatetesellation.htm). This is likely due to differences in the number of significant digits used for the calculations and converting acres into meters.

Hexagon nodes in the grid R creates fall approximately 1.3 meters away from similar nodes for the tessellation generated by ArcGIS. In a 10-acre area, this difference is accounts for 0.64% in distance.
